# About me
I'm Voylin, I grew up in Belgium but moved to Japan in 2020 where I started to work as an English teacher. Since 2023 I've been a solo developer working on a video editor and various other projects, mainly based around Godot.

## YouTube
Content creation is something I've been doing for quite some time now. I have 3 channels in total:
- [Voylin's Gamedev Journey](https://www.youtube.com/@voylinsgamedevjourney)
- [Voylin's Life](https://www.youtube.com/voylin)
- [Voylin sensei](https://www.youtube.com/@voylinsensei)

## My Mission
My mission is to be able to keep working as a developer and run my own company which is focused on making (open-source) software and games. At this time most of my time has been going to [GoZen, my video editor](https://github.com/VoylinsGamedevJourney/gozen), but that project is nearly usable enough in a way that I'll start having a bit more time for other projects.

## Why open-source?
My video editor especially is open source due to there not being any great video editor available for Linux users which doesn't come with a full list of bugs, or with lacking support for the most common codecs.
